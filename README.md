# YouSpec

**Your coding DNA, portable across any AI.**

Document your coding style once - naming, architecture, patterns, preferences - and every AI coding assistant follows it.

## What is this?

YouSpec is a simple, files-only system for documenting your personal coding standards. No tools, no protocols, no databases. Just markdown files that any AI can read.

- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, whatever comes next
- Skills loaded on-demand (AI only reads what's relevant)
- Opinionated: always biased toward simplicity
- Your specs stay local, yours forever

## Quick Start

```
~/.youspec/
  YOUSPEC.md     # Bootstrap file (tells AI what to load)
  gaps.md        # AI logs missing specs here
  skills/
    coding/      # Your coding DNA
    workflows/   # Non-coding skills (debug, review, brainstorm)
```

## Status

Work in progress. See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the full design.
