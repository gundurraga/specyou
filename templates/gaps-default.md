# Gaps

Missing spec topics. When AI encounters a topic with no spec, log it here.

## What to Log

Log MISSING SPEC TOPICS, not decisions made.

**Correct:** `- [ ] **quality/error-handling**: No spec for how to handle errors`
**Wrong:** `- Decided to use try-catch with logging because...`

## Format

`- [ ] **category/topic**: brief description of what needs a spec`

## Workflow

1. AI logs missing topics while working
2. Periodically review accumulated gaps
3. Pick important one, AI asks 10 questions, creates spec
4. Remove the line once spec exists
